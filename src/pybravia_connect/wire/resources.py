"""Nonce-gated, AES-256-GCM-encrypted ``GetResourcesWithAuth`` read (app icons).

App icons are referenced from the application_list entries as
``iot-resource://app-icon/<hash>`` URIs. Fetching one reuses the same
nonce-gated encrypted read as the application list: the full URI is the request
path, the ``GetNonce`` nonce goes in the embedded auth block's field-2 slot
(signed), and the response is AES-256-GCM encrypted with the ``session_key``.
The decrypted plaintext is a small protobuf wrapper —
``{1: {1: <uri>, 2: <image bytes>}}`` — so the actual image (WEBP on many TVs)
is a nested field, extracted below.
